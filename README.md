leel-third-party

This repository contains all third-party libraries and repositories that is used
by leel systems projects. 

Some of the libraries will be handled as closed projects (proprietary libraries)
others will be handled as git sub modules (Open Project). On the last case, all
repositories will be forked to the leel account to assure that changes can be
controlled by leel systems. If a project uses submodules, those submodules needs
to be forked as well.
